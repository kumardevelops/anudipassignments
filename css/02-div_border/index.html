                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used
                    to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML
                    or XML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It allows developers to control the layout, appearance, and
                    behavior of web pages.

                <h2>What are the disadvances of CSS ?</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS can be very frustrating as it sometimes does not show errors and we need to write too many lines of code to achieve simple tasks.
